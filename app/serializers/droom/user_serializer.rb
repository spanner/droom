# This is user as data object: all the fields we need to manage or present the user.
# It does not include authentication information.
#
# Also note btw that the address book is squashed down to one email, one phone and one mobile.
# We don't yet support remote management of all that detail, but users can update their listing,
# which has the effect of adding a new preferred address but not deleting the old.
